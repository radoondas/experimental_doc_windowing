Our partnership is focused on helping you get more out of both your data and your infrastructure. Building momentum together In our blog a year ago , we highlighted how we have built an enhanced experience that makes it easier for you to bring in data from many different sources so you can transform data into actionable insights using native integration within the Azure portal . Our early innovation and collaboration in this area is now recognized as part of an official Microsoft service, which includes leading ISVs like Elastic: Azure Native ISV Service . What is Azure Native ISV Service? An Azure Native ISV Service enables you to easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate independent software vendor (ISV) software and services on Azure. Features include unified operations and several integrations \u2014 all designed to make your life easier. So what does this mean for you? Well, given these challenging economic times, this service gets you to value even faster. As outlined in our documentation , the Azure Native ISV Service for Elastic Cloud allows you to deploy managed instances of the Elastic Stack directly in Azure through the Azure integrated marketplace (aka the Azure console).

Our colleagues at Microsoft published a blog to help answer this question. However, if you\u2019re still trying to determine how your organization could benefit from Elastic Cloud on Azure, we have a number of solutions that can help you with diverse challenges. With all the current industry buzz around generative AI, you might be interested to read how Mr. Turing , a leader in cognitive search, leveraged Elasticsearch on Azure to speed up results and lower costs. Another interesting example is Cranfield University in the UK. In order to do more with less, Cranfield migrated to Elastic Cloud running on Microsoft Azure. According to Network Specialist Luke Whitworth, \"Elastic Cloud on Microsoft Azure offers us a fast, scalable, and unified solution.
